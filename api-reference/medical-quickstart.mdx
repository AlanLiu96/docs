### Overview
In this quickstart, we will retrieve benefits for a patient for a medical provider. We will walk through the requests needed to create an inquiry and retrieve the results.

### Create an Inquiry

Let's walk through an example of how to create an inquiry using a POST request.

You will need to provide the necessary information to verify the patient's benefits on behalf of the provider including the procedure codes you are interested in checking.

Make sure to also include one or more `benefits_query` to specify the type of information that's needed. For instance, in addition to `CODE_LOOKUP_BENEFITS` which retrieves just the copay and coinsurance for the procedure codes, you can also include `CODE_LOOKUP_PRIOR_AUTH` to check if a prior authorization is required for the procedure codes and/or `CODE_LOOKUP_FREQUENCIES` to check the frequency limitations for the procedure codes. Some basic plan information (e.g. plan type, effective date, termination date, etc.) will also be included in the response by default, but you'll need to include `DEDUCTIBLES_AND_MAXIMUMS` to get the deductibles and maximums.

<Note> In addition to procedure codes, we can also include custom bundles or follow up questions for your procedure as part of our white-glove API onboarding. [Contact us](mailto:alan@healthharbor.co) for details. </Note>

```python Python
import requests
import json

payload = {

```

</CodeGroup>

Successful creations will return this response.

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON
{
  "success": true,
  "inquiry_id": "7d98c8a4-4b17-4e9b-b2f6-6131df874b8b",
}
```

### Retrieve an Inquiry

Now that you've made a medical inquiry, you can check the results with a GET request and the `inquiry_id` returned when you created an inquiry.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -u [PROJECT_ID]:[API_KEY] --request GET "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries/722b06d8-1855-402b-9916-bfa450cc1572"
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries/722b06d8-1855-402b-9916-bfa450cc1572"
response = requests.get(
  url=url,
  auth=([PROJECT_ID], [API_KEY])
)
```

Alternatively, you can instead retrieve information on all the inquiries you've submitted. This can be filtered by the `external_id` you provided when you created the inquiry. Each inquiry will be returned in the array.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -u [PROJECT_ID]:[API_KEY] --request GET "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries"
```

```python Python
import requests

url = 'https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries'
response = requests.get(
  url=url,
  auth=([PROJECT_ID], [API_KEY])
)
```
