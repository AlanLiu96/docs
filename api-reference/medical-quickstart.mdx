</Warning>

### Authentication

Our API is authenticated using HTTP Basic Authentication. You'll need to pass in your credentials with every API request.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -u username:password --request GET https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries
  ```

```python Python
url = 'https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries'

username = 'HEALTH_HARBOR_USERNAME'
password = 'HEALTH_HARBOR_CREDENTIALS'

request = request.get(
  url = url,
  auth=(username, password)
)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Additional Prerequisites

For medical inquiries, we have customized `benefits_query`s for each customer. Please [reach out](mailto:alan@healthharbor.co) to our team to get set up to use our Medical API.

### Create an Inquiry

Let's walk through an example use case of the [Medical API](endpoint/create-medical-inquiry). Say you want to request benefits for certain procedure codes for a patient for a medical provider.

You will need to provide information on the patient, patient's insurance, provider, and the benefits you are interested in checking.

For specific benefits codes, please use `CODE_LOOKUP_BENEFITS` as the `benefits_query` and pass in the specific codes as `benefits_codes`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -u username:password --request POST "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "type": "BENEFITS",
    "desired_completion_date": "08-25-2023",
    "patient_name": "Alex Martin",
    "dob": "01-31-2023",
    "member_id": "567891234",
    "group_id": "678123",
    "insurance_in_network": true,
    "npi": "1234567890",
    "tax_id": "123456789",
    "external_id": "health_harbor_sf",
    "insurance": "UNITED_HEALTHCARE",
    "benefits_query": [
      "PULMONARY_REHAB_COVERAGE"
    ],
    "is_specialist": true,
    "place_of_service": "office"
}'
```

```python Python
  url = 'https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries'

  username = 'HEALTH_HARBOR_USERNAME'
  password = 'HEALTH_HARBOR_CREDENTIALS'

  payload = {
    "type": "BENEFITS",
    "desired_completion_date": "08-25-2023",
    "patient_name": "Alex Martin",
    "dob": "01-31-2023",
    "member_id": "567891234",
    "group_id": "678123",
    "insurance_in_network": true,
    "npi": "1234567890",
    "tax_id": "123456789",
    "external_id": "health_harbor_sf",
    "insurance": "UNITED_HEALTHCARE",
    "benefits_query": [
      "PULMONARY_REHAB_COVERAGE"
    ],
    "is_specialist": true,
    "place_of_service": "office"
}

  response = request.post(
    url = url,
    data=json.dumps(payload),
    auth=(username, password)
  )

```

</CodeGroup>

Successful creations will return an `inquiry_id`. You will need this `inquiry_id` to check on its status and see results.

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON
{
  "success": true,
  "inquiry_id": "7d98c8a4-4b17-4e9b-b2f6-6131df874b8b",
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve an Inquiry

Now that you've made a medical inquiry, you want to check on the results. You can use our API to do so. The `inquiry_id` is required.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -u username:password --request GET "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries/722b06d8-1855-402b-9916-bfa450cc1572"
```

```python Python
  url = 'https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries'

  username = 'HEALTH_HARBOR_USERNAME'
  password = 'HEALTH_HARBOR_CREDENTIALS'

  response = request.get(
    url=url,
    auth=(username, password)
  )
```

</CodeGroup>
