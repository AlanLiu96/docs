### Optional Settings

#### External ID

In addition to patient and practice information needed to complete an inquiry, each operation also supports an optional `external_id` parameter which you can define and pass in with your creation request. This is useful for tracking a specific subgroup of inquiries. For instance, you can assign a unique external id to all inquiries for a specific provider on your platform.

This will allow you to retrieve only the information for that provider and update that information.

#### Custom Benefits Queries

We can create customized benefits queries for you so they you can specify custom follow-up questions or specific information outside the scope of a typical benefits request. For example, we could ask if two procedures can be performed on the same date of service.

Contact [our team](mailto:alan@healthharbor.co), if you'd like to set one up.
