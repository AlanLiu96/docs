### Overview
In this 5 minute quickstart, we will walk through how to submit claim status requests. Each of these requests will trigger a call to the specified insurance payor, and when completed, you'll receive the results at any webhooks you've set up.

### Create an Inquiry

Let's walk through an example of how to create an inquiry using a POST request.

You will need to provide the necessary information to check the claims status. This generally includes information about your provider, patient and the claim.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -u [PROJECT_ID]:[API_KEY] --request POST "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "type": "CLAIMS_STATUS",
    "desired_completion_date": "08-25-2024",
    "patient_name": "Alex Martin",
    "dob": "01-31-2023",
    "member_id": "567891234",
    "insurance": "UNITED_HEALTHCARE",
    "beneficiary":"PRIMARY",
    "npi": "1245319599",
    "tax_id": "123456789",
    "billed_amount": 100.99,
    "claims_date_of_service": "08-01-2024",
    "claim_number": "123456789",
}'
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

url = 'https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries'
payload = {
    "type": "CLAIMS_STATUS",
    "desired_completion_date": "08-25-2024",
    "patient_name": "Alex Martin",
    "dob": "01-31-2023",
    "member_id": "567891234",
    "insurance": "UNITED_HEALTHCARE",
    "beneficiary":"PRIMARY",
    "npi": "1245319599",
    "practice_billing_address": "123 Main St, New York, NY 10001",
    "tax_id": "123456789",
    "billed_amount": 100.99,
    "claims_date_of_service": "08-01-2024",
    "claim_number": "123456789",
}
response = requests.post(
    url = url,
    data=json.dumps(payload),
    auth=([PROJECT_ID], [API_KEY])
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Successful creations will return this response.

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON
{
  "success": true,
  "inquiry_id": "7d98c8a4-4b17-4e9b-b2f6-6131df874b8b",
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve an Inquiry

Now that you've made your first inquiry, you can check the results with a GET request and the `inquiry_id` returned when you created an inquiry. This is an alternative to receiving the results at your webhook which will be sent automatically once the results are complete.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -u [PROJECT_ID]:[API_KEY] --request GET "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries/722b06d8-1855-402b-9916-bfa450cc1572"
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://healthharbor.co/api/v0/medical/inquiries/722b06d8-1855-402b-9916-bfa450cc1572"
response = requests.get(
  url=url,
  auth=([PROJECT_ID], [API_KEY])
)
```

</CodeGroup>
